## Eventing
**Trigger Kubernetes workloads** based on external events. A developer can choose external events that automatically invoke Knative or other Kubernetes workloads from a variety of sources: 

**Infrastructure sources** like VMware vSphere, which makes it possible to build applications on Kubernetes that span many different kinds of workloads from non-Kubernetes systems 

**Community or custom event sources**, which can be used to pull in external events that are sent to Knative Eventing consumers

**Existing event pipelines**, such as RabbitMQ and Kafka

**Connect multiple distinct workloads** with declarative event routing. A developer can connect event producers and consumers with declarative configuration separate from the code itself. This removes the need to write code specific to any individual event stream into applications.
