This workshop will walk you through the fundamentals of knative-serving. 

**What is knative ?**

***Knative (pronounced kay-nay-tiv)*** is an open source community project which adds components for deploying, running, and managing serverless, cloud-native applications to Kubernetes. 


***Make your developers more productive***
Knative components build on top of Kubernetes, abstracting away the complex details and enabling developers to focus on what matters. Built by codifying the best practices shared by successful real-world implementations, Knative solves the "boring but difficult" parts of deploying and managing cloud native services so you don't have to.
